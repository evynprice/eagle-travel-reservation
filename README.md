Golden Eagle Travel agency would like to implement a travel reservation system. The system enables the customer to search for airline flights and cruise for two travel cities on a specified date, choose a flight based on the details, booking and cancellation of flight.

The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the journey details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.

After search the system display list of available flights and allows customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a seat. Otherwise, it asks the user to choose another flight.

The main purpose of this software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the airline reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a particular reservation.
